# repbot
Bot for artificially influencing rankings on discordbots.org

### Usage
To use the program, go to [discordbots.org](discordbots.org) and find the bot
you want to upvote. Once you are on the bot's page, get its ID from the URL.

In the below link, the ID is `159985870458322944`, which belongs to mee6:
[http://discordbots.org/bot/159985870458322944/vote](http://discordbots.org/bot/159985870458322944/vote).

Once you have copied the ID, paste it as the value for the `bot` variable in
`start.js`. You must also paste your Discord login credentials in the `email`
and `password` variables. As this is open source, you can tell that there is no
possible way that I can steal your login information, so don't freak out.
